# 🚀 MeridianDB v1.0.0 — Release Notes

### Overview

MeridianDB is now **feature-complete** and ready to ship. This release finalizes the architecture for an **AI-first database** that redefines retrieval for agents — going beyond semantic search with **temporal, contextual, and behavioral dimensions**.

Our mission is to solve **catastrophic forgetting** in AI systems, helping agents strike the right balance between stability and plasticity.

### ✨ What’s New in v1.0.0

* **Integrated Consistency Model**

  * Queue-based architecture ensures eventual consistency without developer orchestration.
  * Redundant storage (Vector + D1) preserves multidimensional context and reliability.

* **Multi-Dimensional Retrieval Engine**

  * **Semantic:** Over-fetched, refined retrieval beyond standard RAG pipelines.
  * **Temporal:** Data decays over time, supports factual/irrelevant tagging, and frequency weighting.
  * **Contextual:** Filters results by task, environment, and developer-defined context.
  * **Behavioral:** Tracks retrieval impact on tasks for continuous feedback and improvement.

* **Cloudflare-Native Architecture**

  * Global low-latency access.
  * Event-driven processing for scalable and cost-efficient operations.
  * Automatic retries, failover, and eventual consistency built-in.

* **Operational Simplicity**

  * No need to glue multiple databases together — SDK + Operator UI included.
  * Simple developer API: `store`, `retrieve`, `log`.

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

* Worker API gateway handles human and SDK requests.
* Eventual consistency via write queues and workers for vectorization.
* SQL-based feature scoring (no graph traversal) for performance and scalability.
* Built-in behavioral logging creates feedback loops for task success tracking.

### 🛠️ Benefits

1. **Integrated Consistency & Reliability** – No ghost embeddings, fewer race conditions.
2. **Simple Developer Experience** – One API, no orchestration headaches.
3. **Native AI Feedback Loop** – Behavioral insights for better retrieval over time.
4. **Cloudflare-Native Scalability** – Low-latency global access by default.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

* **Eventual Consistency:** Reads may lag slightly after writes.
* **Feature Engineering:** Developers must supply contextual features (future auto-context generation planned).
* **Storage Cost:** Temporal decay requires periodic cleanup jobs.
* **Learning Curve:** New retrieval model may require time to adopt.
* **Cloudflare Coupling:** Architecture is optimized for Cloudflare ecosystem.
