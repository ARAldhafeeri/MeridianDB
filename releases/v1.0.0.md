# Realse v1.0.0

The realse focus on core features setting merdidian federated DB for the full version. 

Since the realease has only four weeks to deliver we will focus on the following core features :
- Cross-session memory persistence
- Semantic search over agent interactions
- Simple knowledge graph relationships between embedded entties.
- Multi-agent memory sharing (within single org initially)
- Multi-dim contextual searching.

Even though the following :
- Analytics ( partially just basic analytics  )
- Fedeartion ( memory sharing across agents, across organzations)
- Multi-tanency 

Rearchitecture :
- Instead of storing graph structure in SQL database like D1 and running into issues like handling coordination and race conditions. The data will be stored in tabular format and vectorize role will be only to store vector and cluster info. There will be agent that going to extract the multi-dim data for each operating agent memory : semantic, temporal, contextual, behavioral. 

This reachitecture will insure deliverabilty of 

Is all layed off as interfaces, however delivering all is nearly impossible in four weeks. Starting with 1 org memory sharing for multiple agents is good start, we will solve the other problems later.
